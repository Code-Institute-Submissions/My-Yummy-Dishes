The My Yummy Dishes website is database website, where an user can view their recipes and that of other users. An user must

<h3>Design</h3>

I have used the a program called Figma that help design the the pages and keep the pages as easy to use and uncluttered.
The user can see and read everything with searching for what the are looking for. The approach of the design was to make
the website as inviting for everyone.

I have changed the placemnent of the header image to the body image and the shape of the cards.
